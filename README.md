# Social-Web-with-Django

Using any Frontend Framework in this project. I will use HTML, CSS (Bootstrap and some custom CSS) in the project.

 It would be a simple Social Media Website where users can do the following things:

 1. Post images along with description and tags. You can update or delete them anytime.

 2. View otherâ€™s profile and send them a friend request or cancel if you have sent one by mistake.

 3. Accept or decline friend requests received from other users.

 4. Unfriend existing friends.

 5. Search posts on basis of tags.

 6. Search users based on their username.

 7. Discover new people section to recommend new people to add as friends based on mutual connections.
